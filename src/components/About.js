                        Born in the humble city of Federal Way, WA, and raised in multiple different
                        areas in TX and Korea, I was constantly tested and pushed to explore who I was as an individual. Through this diversity, I found many different passions in sports(Volleyball, Basketball, Football), arts(Photography & Digital Media), games(Video & Board), and music(Most Genre), all of which shaped the person I am today.
